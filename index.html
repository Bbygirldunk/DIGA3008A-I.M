    <h2>Setting Up GitHub</h2>
    <p>My experience with GitHub was mostly awful. To be honest, "mostly" is an understatement. Setting up GitHub has to be one of the most difficult things I've done in my life. The road was difficult at first, and there were even times when I questioned the validity of my own existence, such as if repositories and commits had truly decreased the value of my life. Even though the pushing and pulling struggle is still ongoing, I am thankful for the tutorials we have on navigating this monstrosity of an invention, although they have made me feel like I have dyslexia. Publishing to pages was, well, as the saying goes, not "rocket science.". It was seamlessly interesting and new to me even though every time I open GitHub, it feels like a new thing. I am eager to make my relationship with GitHub work, though I don't really have a choice.</p>
