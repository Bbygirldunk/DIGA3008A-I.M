  <article class="Setting Up GitHub">
    <h2>Setting Up GitHub</h2>
    <p>My experience with GitHub was mostly awful. To be honest, "mostly" is an understatement. Setting up GitHub has to be one of the most difficult things I've done in my life. The road was difficult at first, and there were even times when I questioned the validity of my own existence, such as if repositories and commits had truly decreased the value of my life. Even though the pushing and pulling struggle is still ongoing, I am thankful for the tutorials we have on navigating this monstrosity of an invention, although they have made me feel like I have dyslexia. Publishing to pages was, well, as the saying goes, not "rocket science.". It was seamlessly interesting and new to me even though every time I open GitHub, it feels like a new thing. I am eager to make my relationship with GitHub work, though I don't really have a choice.</p>

  <article class="History of the Web">
    <h2>Interesting Facts About the History of the Web</h2>
    <p>Every day, I use the Internet, and I can't picture my existence without it. But I just discovered that I didn't know what I was using. I now know that the Web was founded by the legendary Tim Berners-Lee. Although many others contributed to the development of the Web as it exists today, I have to give Tim his props for coming up with such a lovely idea. I've now figured out what HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is and how web pages are made with it. It's fascinating to learn about the origins of something so integral to our daily lives. The evolution of the web from basic text-based pages to the interactive multimedia experience we have today is another fascinating aspect of its history. I found out about the importance and development of the URL, that it was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 to provide a way to access different resources on the Internet. This innovation altered how we navigated and interacted with the Web. I also discovered that social media was not always present and that there were Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, which allowed for significantly greater participation from people. With its emphasis on user-generated content and social networking platforms, I would classify what we are currently using as Web 2.0.</p>

  <article class="Readings">
    <h2>Interesting Read</h2>
    <p> I chose an interesting read by Borges called The Library of Babel (1944), which we discussed in class. It blew my mind that such old literature could still be so relevant in this day and age. In basic terms, Borges discusses the unlimited nature of knowledge and information, which is consistent with the limitless potential of user-generated content on Web 2.0 platforms. This link between literature and technology emphasizes the timeless themes that still shape our digital experiences today. He describes the universe as a massive library comprised of countless hexagonal chambers. Every wall in the room has bookcases full of books. The rooms are connected by passageways, each of which contains a modest sleeping area and a bathroom. We are the librarians who are navigating the library. This is true for both human life and the web. We, the customers, are constantly trying to navigate the seemingly unlimited amount of information that is available to us. Just because it is all there doesn't mean we need it all or that all of the information is useful, so we are now not only looking continuously because no one can actually obtain all of the knowledge they require, but we are also filtering out what we don't need. It'ss all fascinating.</p>

<h2> My Goals</h2>
<p> My goals for this course are simple: to gain vast knowledge. I want you to be able to see the world through my lens. To be honest, this doesn't make much sense to me yet, but it should suffice for the moment.</p>
