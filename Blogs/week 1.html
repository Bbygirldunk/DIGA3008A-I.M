    <h1>Week 1 Blog: Setting Up GitHub & Web History</h1>

      <h2>Setting Up GitHub</h2>
      <p>
        My experience with GitHub was mostly awful. To be honest, "mostly" is an
        understatement. Setting up GitHub has to be one of the most difficult
        things I've done in my life. The road was difficult at first, and there
        were even times when I questioned the validity of my own existence,
        such as if repositories and commits had truly decreased the value of my
        life. Even though the pushing and pulling struggle is still ongoing, I
        am thankful for the tutorials we have on navigating this monstrosity
        of an invention, although they have made me feel like I have
        dyslexia. Publishing to pages was, well, as the saying goes, not
        "rocket science." It was seamlessly interesting and new to me even
        though every time I open GitHub, it feels like a new thing. I am eager
        to make my relationship with GitHub work, though I don't really have a
        choice.

      <h2>Interesting Facts About the History of the Web</h2>
      <p>
        Every day, I use the Internet, and I can't picture my existence without
        it. But I just discovered that I didn't know what I was using. I now
        know that the Web was founded by the legendary Tim Berners-Lee.
        Although many others contributed to the development of the Web as it
        exists today, I have to give Tim his props for coming up with such a
        lovely idea. I've now figured out what HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
        is and how web pages are made with it. It's fascinating to learn about
        the origins of something so integral to our daily lives. The evolution
        of the web from basic text-based pages to the interactive multimedia
        experience we have today is another fascinating aspect of its history.
        I found out about the importance and development of the URL, that it
        was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 to provide a way to access
        different resources on the Internet. This innovation altered how we
        navigated and interacted with the Web. I also discovered that social
        media was not always present and that there were Web 1.0 and Web 2.0,
        which allowed for significantly greater participation from people.
        With its emphasis on user-generated content and social networking
        platforms, I would classify what we are currently using as Web 2.0.

    <section class="readings">
      <h2>Interesting Read: The Library of Babel by Borges</h2>
      <p>
        I chose an interesting read by Borges called <em>The Library of Babel</em>
        (1944), which we discussed in class. It blew my mind that such old
        literature could still be so relevant in this day and age. In basic
        terms, Borges discusses the unlimited nature of knowledge and
        information, which is consistent with the limitless potential of
        user-generated content on Web 2.0 platforms. This link between
        literature and technology emphasizes the timeless themes that still
        shape our digital experiences today. He describes the universe as a
        massive library comprised of countless hexagonal chambers. Every wall
        in the room has bookcases full of books. The rooms are connected by
        passageways, each of which contains a modest sleeping area and a
        bathroom. We are the librarians who are navigating the library. This
        is true for both human life and the web. We, the customers, are
        constantly trying to navigate the seemingly unlimited amount of
        information that is available to us. Just because it is all there
        doesn't mean we need it all or that all of the information is useful,
        so we are now not only looking continuously because no one can actually
        obtain all of the knowledge they require, but we are also filtering
        out what we don't need. It's all fascinating.

      <h2>My Goals</h2>
      <p>
        My goals for this course are simple: to gain vast knowledge. I want you
        to be able to see the world through my lens. To be honest, this doesn't
        make much sense to me yet, but it should suffice for the moment.
