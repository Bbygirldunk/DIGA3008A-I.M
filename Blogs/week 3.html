    <h2>User Alignment</h2>
    <p>I would like to believe that if I could see inside my soul, I would probably find an ice cream land. Someplace cute, soft, and playful. That is what I would like to achieve with my website's design. The goal is to design a website that aligns with users who want to feel immersed in a world of cuteness, sweetness, and soft, playful aesthetics. My website will typically align with users who appreciate modern artistry, and people who love absorbing stylish visuals and pastel colors. It would be best for individuals who enjoy playful interactions and charming animations while prioritizing a seamless, intuitive interface that feels satisfying to explore

        The content, user experience, and interface elements should ideally be engaging, playful, and well-curated.</p>

  <article class="Website Content">
    <h1> Homepage</h1>
    <p> -High-resolution and strikingly eye-catching pastel-toned illustrations with a playful tagline such as "A Portfolio Sweet As Ice Cream" or "Scoop Up My Creativity." A navigation bar that has playful symbols and a fun CTA like "Explore the flavors"</p>  
    <h2> Portfolio Page</h2
    <p>A portfolio page "Flavours of my Creativity" will be a grid-based Pinterest-style gallery with hover effects to display my work and project having a fun-flavored theme (e.g., "Strawberry Swirl: My UI Design Work") or something like this.</p>
    <h1> Blog Posts Page</h1>
    <p> Would look something like my portfolio page. It will have a certain amount of interactivity and a whole lot of engagement. Reading will be made fun on this page.</p>
    <h1> About Page</h1>
    <p> "Meet the Ice Cream Maker."
        An about page that is interactive should allow the users to be engaged and want to get to know more about the creator, myself.</p>
    <h1> Contact Page</h1>
    <p> A well-written and executed page should leave the viewers wanting to know more about the person they have been reading about outside of the website, into other platforms, or better yet, leave the users wanting to collaborate with the website's creator, which is the ultimate goal.</p>

    <article class = "User Experience">
        <h1> User Experiene</h1>
        <p> I want the user experience to be a sweet and smooth journey, much like eating a nice, cold ice cream, and I could most likely achieve that through the use of smooth transitions with melting animations when navigating, hover effects, and speed. A responsive UX is the goal. Instead of a regular boring spinner, things like a delightful loading screen with a melting ice cream animation will feel different and exciting, increasing user engagement. Ultimately, the experience should be an easy, cool, smooth, and delicious experience as they navigate their way around a world with soft, creamy, and playful color palettes and elegant, friendly typography.</p>
        <p> I would say that this has helped me think about the ways I have explained and broken down my user alignment, site's content, UX, and interface elements. It has made it more practical for me to be able to create a meaningful URL scheme and HTML that is structured, making my website accessible and easy to maintain.
