      <h2>What Is An Ethical Internet?</h2>
      <p>An ethical internet, to me, is one that puts human dignity first. It's one where people feel safe, where privacy is respected and where individuals have control over how their data is used and shared. At its core, an ethical internet must be built on the principles of safety, inclusivity, accountability, and transparency.</p>

      <p>Online safety is about more than keeping people safe from bad content, it is about making the online environment a place where individuals are not harassed, doxxed, or attacked due to who they are. Online spaces currently mirror real-world inequalities in society and even in some instances intensify them. Women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and marginalized groups are habitually harassed and it remains unchecked. An ethical internet would address this with rigorous content moderation and community standards that put harm reduction first without suppressing valid discussion.</p>

      <p>A second pillar is privacy. In our current digital ecosystem users are less treated as individuals and more like data points. Each scroll, search and click is tracked, saved and typically sold on to advertisers. This commodification of activity comes with little genuine consent or knowledge. I believe an ethical internet must give users full transparency and control over their data, not just in lengthy terms and conditions but in ways that are meaningful and accessible. That means embracing approaches like data minimalism where only the data that's necessary is collected and where privacy is the default, not the exception.</p>

      <p>Protection also extends to digital rights, the right to speak, to organize, to be there online without being monitored or censored unfairly. As Stein (2008) notes much of the internet while considered public is actually privately owned and controlled. This leads to a paradox where speech is formally free but pragmatically limited. In an ethical internet individuals wouldn't have to rely on the benevolence of tech firms to exercise their rights. Instead, there would be structures to guarantee those rights in the same manner that public protections are in place in the physical world.</p>

      <p>Papacharissi (2020) speaks about the idea of the "virtual sphere", the projection of the public sphere into the virtual space. But she also says that while the internet holds out promise for democratic involvement it too often fails to deliver due to commercialization and a lack of equitable access. An ethical internet would have to reclaim that democratic potential. It would be constructed not just for profit or efficiency but to promote civic engagement, critical debate and equal access for all.</p>

      <p>Lastly, an ethical internet is not just a technical project, it's an ethical one. We need to think about whose voices are amplified, whose data is safeguarded and who benefits from the systems we design. It requires responsibility not just of users but of developers, platforms and states too. If we are going to wish the internet to be a space of connection, learning and growth, then ethics must be built in, not bolted on afterwards.</p>
