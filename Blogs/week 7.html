    <h2>UX & UI Analysis – Essay 1 Website Candidates</h2>

    <p>This week, I started exploring possible websites I could analyze for my first essay on UX and UI design. My aim is to pick a site that offers both visual richness and a strong user experience. Something with soul, intention, and elegance, or even something frustrating (because those can teach us a lot too). Here are some of the ones I’ve considered:</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Clean and elegant UI, intuitive UX, strong use of white space, smooth animations, responsive design across all devices. Every page feels luxurious.</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Because it's so refined, it may be harder to critique, flaws are subtle and subjective. Might not offer much contrast or unexpected surprises.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.etsy.com">Etsy</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Warm, handcrafted aesthetic. A platform built around creative sellers, and it does a good job reflecting that through design. Personalization and search UX are well-developed.</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Can feel cluttered. Navigation sometimes feels slightly overwhelming with too many filters, promotions, or CTAs competing for attention.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.patagonia.com">Patagonia</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Emotionally engaging design, sustainable values woven into UI. Beautiful visuals and storytelling through layout and interactions. Also highly accessible.</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Some parts of the shopping experience feel slightly less dynamic. It’s very purpose-driven, which means some users might find it too niche.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.lush.com">Lush</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Bold visuals, fun typography, engaging product pages with videos and gifs. Their brand personality is everywhere in the UI, which is playful and rich.</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> The vibrancy might be overwhelming to some users. Animations can slow performance on older devices.</p>

    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>At this point, I’m leaning toward either Patagonia or Lush — they both align with the kind of emotional, aesthetic, and intentional web design that I’m interested in exploring. I want a site that feels alive, like someone cared deeply about the person experiencing it. That’s what I want for my own site, a space that feels like soft gradients and curiosity in motion.</p>
