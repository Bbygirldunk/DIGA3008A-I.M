      <h2>Magenya (2020) – Making a Feminist Internet in Africa</h2>
      <p>Reading Salome Magenya’s <em>Making a Feminist Internet in Africa</em> made me stop and think about how I use the internet. I’ve always thought of the internet as this open, global space where anyone can express themselves or connect with others. But Magenya blows that idea out of the water. She shows how the internet, like every other system, is shaped by power, by patriarchy, capitalism, and colonial histories. That stuck with me.</p>
      
      <p>What I found most powerful was her point that African feminists don’t just need access to the internet, they need to be part of rethinking and rebuilding it. She talks about how the internet silences or erases African women’s voices, even while pretending to be open and democratic. That made me think of how global conversations are dominated by Western perspectives, even in feminist spaces. I saw a connection here to postcolonial feminism—the idea that we can’t treat all women’s experiences as the same, and that Western frameworks often ignore or misrepresent the realities of women in the Global South.</p>
      
      <p>Magenya’s idea that we’re not just using the internet but actively making it really changed my thinking. I hadn’t considered how my own choices—like which platforms I use, who I follow, or what I choose to share—are all part of shaping what kind of internet we have. It made me realize I have more agency than I thought, but also more responsibility.</p>
      
      <p>She also talks about how online spaces aren’t separate from offline realities. The violence and silencing that African women experience in real life follow them online too. That hit hard because it challenges this idea that the internet automatically creates freedom or equality. It doesn’t, at least not unless it’s intentionally designed that way.</p>
      
      <p>Overall, this reading made me realize technology isn’t neutral. Magenya’s call for African feminists to be central in building the internet isn’t just about making space—it’s about changing the foundation. I left the piece thinking about how I can be more mindful and critical of the digital spaces I inhabit and help shape. It’s not enough to be online. I need to ask what kind of internet I’m participating in, and who it’s built for.</p>
