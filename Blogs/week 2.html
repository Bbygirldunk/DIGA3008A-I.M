    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p> Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’ was written well before the internet took dominance but is much more relevant to this day and age. Stuart Moulthrop contrasts Theodor Holm Nelson’s vision of Xanadu with the notion of hyperreality to explore the tension between hypertext as a tool for empowerment and hypertext as a medium that blurs reality and simulation in ways that might be disorienting or even oppressive. I believe that Nelson had an epic idea to create a non-linear knowledge network that would allow users to link, retrieve, and compare documents dynamically. Nelson imagined the user being able to interact with the information by bidirectional linking, where a document could be linked back to all the places it was referenced. Essentially, Nelson's goal was to make knowledge more dynamic. Moulthrop, however, brings the concept of hyperreality to critique the potential dangers of hypertext. Moulthrop raises some valid points on how hypertext, according to Nelson's vision could be a good thing but also be a bad thing. Moulthrop argues that hypertext, rather than clarifying knowledge, might contribute to this collapse of meaning. If I am trying to navigate an infinite web of links, I would end up getting disorientated making it difficult for me to form coherent understanding. A great example of this on the modern internet is social media. There are so many rabbit holes one might end up finding themselves in trying to get a sense of truth. The truth nowadays has become more relative due to the many sources people can get information from. Moulthrop doesn't outright reject Nelson's vision, he raises very good points about hypertext, which is highly relatable in the time we are living in.</p>
