    <h2>The Design Process</h2>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>My design process is mostly smooth. I noticed how I changed a lot of things. I want my website to have a modern, Pinterest-like aesthetic with gradient pastel colors and minimalistic elements.
    In essence, it should look like this:</p>

    <img src="../Images/Picture1.jpg" height="165" width="480" alt="Homepage Wireframe">

    <p>Above is my ideal homepage; it has a navigation bar with a simple font, a playful title (that won't be the real title), and a little introductory text. Next to it are little profiles you can click on that will act like the navigation bar. The gradient background color is subject to change slightly.</p>

    <p>This is what my portfolio page will look like. Very minimalistic.</p>

    <p>My blog page will have grids as shown below.</p>

    <p>My about page will provide adequate information about me. On either side of the screen, there will be links to the previous pages in the website and/or any other links.</p>

    <p>The last page, which is the contacts page, will have everything the viewer will need to get a hold of me and will also look something like the about page.</p>

    <p>For this design wireframe I used Canva to create it.</p>

    <p>Overall, my progress for Website One isn't all bad, although I know I could still do more. I am struggling with filtering the kind of information that is good practice versus brain rot. Even with the information overload, I am proud of the basics I have gotten down so far. Moving forward, I want to make it look better and run smoothly.</p>
