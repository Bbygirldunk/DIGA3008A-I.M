   <h1> Design Process</h1> 
   <p>My design process is mostly smooth. I noticed how I changed a lot of things. I want my website to have a modern, Pinterest-like aesthetic with gradient pastel colors and minimalistic elements.
   In essence, it should look like this:</p>
   <img src="Images/Picture1.jpg", height="165", width="480"></src>
   <p> Above is my ideal homepage; it has a navigation bar with a simple font, a playful title (that won't be the real title), and a little introductory text. Next to it are little profiles you can click on that will act like the navigation bar. The gradient background color is subject to change slightly.
