   <h1> Design Process</h1> 
   <p>My design process is mostly smooth. I noticed how I changed a lot of things. I want my website to have a modern, Pinterest-like aesthetic with gradient pastel colors and minimalistic elements.
   In essence, it should look like this:</p>
   <img src="../Images/Picture1.jpg", height="165", width="480"></src>
   <p> Above is my ideal homepage; it has a navigation bar with a simple font, a playful title (that won't be the real title), and a little introductory text. Next to it are little profiles you can click on that will act like the navigation bar. The gradient background color is subject to change slightly.
</p>
<p> This is what my portfolio page will look like. Very minimalistic. </p>
<img src="../Images/Picture2.jpg", height="165", width="480"></src>
<p> My blog page will have grids as shown below.</p>
<img src="../Images/Picture3.jpg", height="165", width="480"></src>
<p> My about page will provide adequate information about me. On either side of the screen, there will be links to the previous pages in the website and/or any other links. </p>

<p> The last page which is the contacts page will have everything the viewer will need to get a hold of me and will also look something the about page.</p>

<p> For this design wireframe I used canvas to create it.</p>
<p> Overall, my progress for website one isn't all bad, although I know I could still do more. I am struggling with filtering the kind of information that is good practice and brain rot. Even with the information overload , I am proud of the basics I have gotten down so far. Moving forward I want to make it look better and run smoothly.</p>
