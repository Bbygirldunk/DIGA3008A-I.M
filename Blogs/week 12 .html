      <h2>Decolonialism and Code</h2>
      <p>When we view how code relates to colonialism, we're not only looking at how it looks but also at inclusion—who it includes and excludes, whether it's accessible, and if so, for whom and how. We look at cultural sensitivity and resisting dominant power structures in digital spaces.</p>

      <p>With that being said, I am now going to show you examples of how I have not achieved everything I mentioned above in my code. These are some design choices that I need to be aware of in a decolonial context. I'll begin with my hardcoded English. My interface, content, navigation, and everything you'll see in my website are in English only, and that is not how a decolonial design should be. A decolonial design invites multilingualism and aims to reflect on indigenous and local languages.</p>

      <p>I use fonts such as Poppins and Playfair Display, which are mostly rooted in Western design aesthetics, and I had not considered how these font choices reflect or even exclude cultural diversity. Overall, my website definitely leans towards Western standards of professionalism and beauty instead of really reflecting my cultural history and story.</p>

      <p>I added JavaScript to my site to enhance user interaction and responsiveness. One of the main changes was a mobile navigation toggle using JavaScript to allow users to expand or collapse the navigation menu on smaller screens. This required a menu toggle button and a script that toggles a CSS class on the navigation links when the button is clicked.</p>

      <p>Another change was scroll-based animations or navigation behaviors to provide smooth transitions and make the user experience more fun by adding motion and responsiveness to the interface. I also structured my HTML and CSS to support these scripts. For example, I made sure certain elements had specific classes or IDs that JavaScript could target.</p>

      <p>With these changes, I can create a more intuitive interface. Instead of cluttering the screen with all the navigation on small devices, I can now have a minimal menu that only appears when needed. This fits with my goal of a minimalist, beautiful design and a usable site. And with JavaScript, I can create dynamic and reactive behavior without page reloads or relying on CSS only. This is a smoother, more immersive experience that matches the elegant and dreamy feel I’m going for.</p>
